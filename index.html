        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          Hi, I'm bb—a passionate traveler, tech enthusiast, and dreamer who
          thrives on creativity and discovery. Currently pursuing my bachelor's
          degree in Computer Engineering, I enjoy crafting elegant solutions to
          complex problems while embracing the limitless possibilities of
          technology. I am also exploring the world of iOS app development with
          Swift, aiming to build user-friendly, impactful applications.
        </p>
        <p>
          Beyond coding, I find joy in immersing myself in the beauty of
          Gujarati literature. My cultural roots inspire me to delve into the
          richness of language and heritage, which I often reflect upon during
          my travels. My fascination with storytelling, whether through words or
          visuals, fuels my desire to share experiences that connect and
          inspire.
        </p>
        <p>
          Traveling is more than just a hobby for me—it's a way of life. From
          the golden sands of Jaisalmer to the vibrant streets of Ahmedabad,
          every journey has gifted me with unique memories and broadened my
          perspective. Through this website, I aspire to document my adventures,
          celebrate my heritage, and inspire others to embrace curiosity and
          exploration.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I'm not working on tech projects or planning my next trip, you'll
          find me enjoying music, experimenting with photography, or unwinding
          with a good book. I believe in living life with passion, purpose, and
          a sense of wonder.
